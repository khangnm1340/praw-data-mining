She gives Denji her blood, which turned warm after she experienced being emotionally valued by other living beings, as appreciation for Denji being her first friend and her blood is also symbolic of her affection that she gives to Denji as a transaction because he is also starved for affection and love.

You ignore moments like Angron and Lorgar almost dying by a 400 ton mech trying to step on them, and Angron barely managing to stop it for example.\n\n\nThe second is that you dont critically think of what punching a hole through a ship means. Space ships are not solid, full things, and breaking through one only means Angron broke through the ship armor. And thus made the ship depresurrise. If I remember the feat correctly, there were also mentions there of Angron breaking through and flying to the munition and fuel of the ship(which would create aditional damage to the ship, beyond what his own strenght would do, and weakening it).\n\n\nOn the feat with the gate, while it happened, and it is better then any direct strenght feat from Chainsaw Man, it is not hard to believe that other characters can reach this strength level. Multiple normal devils can destroy buildings with their attacks, and some like Cockroach are themselves Kaiju scale in size, and even Denji could physically fight him on an even footing. I previously mentioned the feat of Makima and Spear throwing Pochita into space, and while not as strong as What Angron did(even if betrer then what any mortal character from 40k did), the following feat of Pochita tanking this, and then ripping hia own heart strongly indicates he is vastly beyond this. When talking about destructive capabilities and long range attacks, Chainsaw Man high tiers are also clearly in the same or superior range to that Angron feat.\n\n\nYou also ignore speed. While speed is not the most consisten(for either side), it is an important plot point that the Gun Devil can cover the world in minutes, putting it at hundreds of times the speed of sound, faster then any 40k character outside thw Warp or areas where Warp and Real-space merge or intermingle.\n\n\nFinally, on Magnus......lol no. The idea he can turn the devils into\u00a0 haos Shawn is illogical. The Devils are their own metaphysical creatures, formed from a similar but slightly distinct metaphysical system as the one of 40k. The idea he could coreupt them is.....illogical.\n\n\nAll in all, you are quite wrong.", "score": 4, "author": "Ecstatic-Network-917", "created_utc": 1753438682.0, "created_vietnam": "2025-07-25 17:18:02 +07"}

Pochita never activates his trigger, he passively heals, just like the primals. Pochita has not once pulled his devil trigger in Devil form\n\n7. Theres nothing indicating destroying a devil's heart kills them. Hybrids have literally had their hearts destroyed before and been fine.

Do i actually think that? Not really, or at least i don't have any reason to believe it and i find it way more likely that a lot of that was inspired by his time spent with at least one of the editors of his manga who actually is a trans guy and made a oneshot of his own about a trans character ('To strip the flesh'- Oto Toda). But calling this a 'headcanon' that 'creeps someone out' is a very hostile and uncharitable way to approach the comment that i feel was ultimately lighthearted and a compliment. This may not be a perfect analogy, but imagine that Fujimoto had written a character who, idk, was a paraplegic, in such a way that people who go through the same struggle said 'wow this guy has def experienced this' and i feel like without maybe the same stigma that is associated with gender dysphoria it's easier to see that comment as a compliment and an exaggeration rather than someone 'headcanoning' the author as something. like i said its maybe not the perfect analogy and i am sorry for the rant but i do get a bit sad when i see how any discussion of gd is immediately shut down like this :(", "score": -10, "author": "matx43", "created_utc": 1753386892.0, "created_vietnam": "2025-07-25 02:54:52 +07"}

Their biggest issue is that Michael Bay never expected to make a sequel to ANY of the movies except TLK which tanked and killed the series for good. Every bayformers film was supposed to be the \"final\" one which is likely why death was so apperent, to raise the stakes.\n\n\nPerhaps, if Bay knew he'd be making a movie series rather than a standalone movie, he'd treat the story and the character's lives more carefully. Maybe Optimus would've had a slower devolution into a psycho-murderer, would definitely be underatandable if he'd start as his recognizable \"life is the right of all living beings\" self and slowly devolve into \"fuck it we ball\" the more of his friends he sees dying and the more humanity stabs him and the Autobots in the back. Speaking of humans, would very much prefer the movie length cut from 3 hours to 1 hour 30 minutes and significantly cut down on human scenes. Not saying Bayformers should have no humans but dear god do they catch too much screentime in 4 and 5. At least in 3 it was underatandable as we saw how some humans wanted to save their ass and cut deals with the Decepticons, and how smaller decepticons dispatched of unloyal humans (famous \"my Chinese smart TV when I talk shit about the Chinese government\" scene).", "score": 1, "author": "ofekk214", "created_utc": 1753377094.0, "created_vietnam": "2025-07-25 00:11:34 +07"}

I'm not saying humans can't innately fear fire, they literally do not and I've given proof that they do not innately fear fire. Falling is established to also embody things like descent as in one's life getting worse, or falling into depression. \"If I think the height is deadly, only then will I\" okay dude good. If you slip then you're likely to be filled with fear for a moment as well. Besides that's like debunking the innate nature of the fear of darkness by saying dim lightning isn't very frightening. The greater the fall, the less light there is, the more you're going to fear it. I'm also saying that it would have to quite literally not be a thing for you to not fear aging! You're immortal, why don't you fear aging? Because you do not age! That is the reason why! There is no aging to be feared! You'll still be afraid of your loved ones aging and your belongings decaying if you're particularly attached!  \n\nBabies naturally avoid walk over transparent flooring because they're scared of falling. I don't think they would. If they're discouraged to begin with that means they do fear it anyways. That's not the same, it's incentive against deterrence. It's like \"If I give you a million bucks would you let me slap you? Yes? I guess you have no fear of pain then.\" That's what you're saying. Parents tell children that there's nothing to fear before they jump into a pool, and they're still scared of falling, unlike the blue fire example. A child may still doubt it, as in \"is the fire really cold?\" or \"is this person lying to me?\" but even if a child rationally accepts that they won't be hurt by jumping into a pool, they won't be able to jump because they're too scared.  \n\nYou're acting like I said people were incapable of fearing fire with that point on mortality again. No, you cannot fear fire if you haven't seen it burn things down. If you haven't witnessed fire causing destruction you cannot fear it. If you have THEN you will fear it because you will REMEMBER that you saw it do so. It will seem harmless to you until you understand its threat.  \n  \nI don't think I have to prove to you why people are afraid of sensory deprivation like Darkness, it's a torture method and it literally drives people insane. And what do you want me to tell you? When you're stressed you literally decay in your dreams and then you wake up disturbed. It's a nightmare. Am I supposed to make some groundbreaking discovery in sleep science? This happens to human beings. This is a thing the human brain naturally does.  \n  \n\"If animals can innately fear fire why can't humans\" they have different instincts. That's why. Their genetics are different. Their pattern recognition works differently. Their eyes are different. They see the world different. Different species can respond differently to stimuli. I shouldn't have to tell you this. Again, humans DO NOT fear fire innately.

That is way more than just convenient, that is unbelievably improbable.\n\nNext, the idea that they developed nukes in response to Gun and Tank going missing, I just don't buy it.

Moreover, if the war effort could be benefited by the use of WMDs like nukes, why would the Americans not just use the Tank Devil? Why bother going through the researching, reinventing, developing, testing, etcetera etcetera? For that matter why didn't the Soviets just use their Gun Devil piece?\n\nAnd lastly, is this not just kind of lame? For Yoru, she didn't even deliberately do any of this. This was largely the Church's efforts, they caused the apocalypse and subsequently the wars, so this massive boost in power feels completely unearned. It *literally* fell out of the sky for her.

That's very different from the standard, passive empowerment from fear.\n\n>We literally do not kno if falling is dead or not so why are u jumping to conclusions?\n\nIf Falling isn't dead, that's actually *even worse* because it means that this whole plot point was completely meaningless and didn't need to happen at all lmao", "score": -14, "author": "DataSwarmTDG", "created_utc": 1753320878.0, "created_vietnam": "2025-07-24 08:34:38 +07"}

No side attacks with their weapon of mass destruction (Gun/Tank Devil) because they don't want the other to do it, too.

I'm skimming over the chapters post-Aging Arc, I can't find any indication that it's been *months.* Yoru and Denji go to sleep and wake up in the morning, so like 2 days. Maybe a week, since the news was able to get a decently accurate death/missing persons count from the Gun Goddess event. Where are you getting months from? And if that is true, what the fuck was everyone doing during all that time!?\n\n>Also, while CSM has unconventional and interesting ways in defeating Devils, it equally becomes a meathead series at times in just giving characters simple \"They hit harder with a bigger attack than last time.\"\n\nNormally that's reserved for low tier enemies, and there's a lot more thought put into it most of the time. Denji's simplistic abilities are a contrast to the more complicated enemies he faces, and force him to get more creative than just slashing wildly. In fact his first major fight against the Bat Devil punishes him for being reckless and overaggressive because he bleeds himself dry and has to be saved by Aki from Leech. From then on, he has to be more intelligent, tricking Katana Man, leveraging his immortality against Eternity, drowning Reze, lighting himself on fire against Santa, and of course most impressively of all, outsmarting Makima. Part 1 is a near perfect navigation of simplistic, meatheaded \"hit hard\" powers and how to use them creatively.\n\nBut Yoru? I mean, not like Yoru's action scenes were good to begin with, but just *punching* with nothing special or clever about it is boring even by her standards, against a Primal no less!

{"id": "n4u8iog", "post_id": "1m78ai7", "parent_id": "t1_n4ta6kb", "body": "I\u2019d argue you\u2019re simplifying Bleach and Naruto way too much. For all their features that some call flaws, those series did bring thematic and emotional depth\u2014especially compared to the more copy-paste sh\u014dnen that came later or before. Plenty of moments in Naruto and Bleach broke their own formulas or subverted expectations, while a lot of newer series follow that \"training \u2192 tournament \u2192 big bad \u2192 flashback \u2192 power-up \u2192 win\" pattern almost to the letter. And doing that is not in itself entirely bad. One piece had a tournament arc and people loved it. It didn't even use a lot of tournament stables and somewhat was worst off for it. \n\nYeah, Chainsaw Man is disruptive and definitely appeals to people tired of sh\u014dnen tropes\u2014but that doesn\u2019t make earlier series automatically generic or shallow. We like action series for the reason we came into them. But it's okay to enjoy em for the spectacle and \"oh what's gonna happen next\" excitement. If we only wanted character moments and drama we'd just go watch a slice of life. Just like slice-of-life fans don\u2019t complain when their shows lack action from start to finish, I\u2019m not sure why some action fans insist that their series must be \"mature\" by stripping away the very action and genre tropes that define it.\n\nThat said, I kinda get it\u2014Chainsaw Man\u2019s deviation from standard sh\u014dnen structure definitely boosts its appeal. It offers something fresh for viewers tired of formulaic battles and predictable arcs. But not every series needs to be \u201cdifferent\u201d to be compelling. Sometimes, spectacle and \u201cwhat happens next\u201d excitement are enough\u2014and that\u2019s okay.\n\n Back when Bleach and Naruto dropped, their ideas were fresh. If Chainsaw Man had come out then, it might\u2019ve been seen as edgy-for-edgy\u2019s-sake, or too chaotic to follow. Everything ages under the same lens eventually\u2014what\u2019s \u201csubversive\u201d today might look formulaic tomorrow.\n\nThat's why I think it's more useful to compare Chainsaw Man to short-lived titles that genuinely leaned hard into tropes without adding anything new\u2014like Toriko, Build King, Candy Flurry, or even Buso Renkin. Those are series that stuck to formula and got axed because they didn\u2019t evolve past it. At least Bleach and Naruto succeeded before the genre got saturated.\n\nSo yeah, Chainsaw Man is doing something different\u2014but let's not act like it's the pinicle and all the more popular stuff is below us because of narrative ambition or thematic weight. The whole sh\u014dnen scene is layered, and just because some fans hyperfixate on powerscaling or \u201casspull\u201d drama doesn\u2019t mean the person's interests are shallow. They just like what they like and commented on it. Honestly, your point about Yoru\u2019s power-up being thematic rather than mechanical works\u2014and that\u2019s the kind of nuance that earlier series had too, just delivered in their own way, is all I'm saying.\n\nI agree with most of your points\u2014I just didn\u2019t love the shots at the big boys. If you\u2019d included One Piece in the lineup for some spice, I\u2019d be with you. I love One Piece, but let\u2019s be real: it gets off the hook way too often. Meanwhile, Bleach and Naruto rarely get any deep dives into what they actually did well. They\u2019re too often dismissed as \u201cjust action\u201d with no plot or depth, which is wildly unfair.\n\nHonestly, I think some arcs in Bleach and Naruto were more exciting or emotionally resonant than a few in One Piece\u2014and the art and action choreography sometimes hit harder, too. Yeah, One Piece has more complexity overall, but it also helps when you\u2019ve got 1100+ chapters to develop your world and build fan loyalty.", "score": 0, "author": "bodybones", "created_utc": 1753328793.0, "created_vietnam": "2025-07-24 10:46:33 +07"}

While some devils are depicted with gender attributes, such as feminine or masculine traits, there is no clear indication that devils operate within a matriarchal or patriarchal societal structure. So it could just be convenient, or that\u2019s just how how some are written, which are the boring answers. \n\nFor example, the Doll Devil is \u201cfemale\u201d because most Dolls themselves are perhaps\u2026 feminine? Unless you include \u201cAction Figures\u201d as dolls as well, then that may or may not change. Which makes the Doll Devil either assuming a female form to reflect that, or to appear more warm and less of a threat than she actually is.\n\nI would argue that most are functional androgynous as their sex/gender has little to do with their roles. If the Gun Devil, Doll Devil, Chainsaw Devil, etc, turned out to be female out of the blue, it wouldn\u2019t change the story. However, this also isn\u2019t true for Makima, Power, Yoru & the Hybrid Devil Reze. Since Denji is so horny all the time as a depressed teenage boy. \n\nIn short, the story does not explore devils as a society with gender-based roles like a matriarchal system.

It\u2019s their physical body now, for all intent & purposes, & it\u2019s fully theirs now. If they\u2019re body dies, they literally do as well. Chainsaw Man\u2019s fiends are conscious, & aware, & not rotting corpse. Actually, their bodies are implied to be fully alive. Power isn\u2019t just \u201cjoyriding\u201d a corpse, it is her body and it defecates, grows hair, and all the other things a human body would do, more or less. She stinks, because of her lack of personally hygiene, from leveling like an animal earlier. She probably didn\u2019t have to worry about this as an Eldritch Horror. There is a better argument that she is a form of ghoul, though. As I\u2019m not sure if all her organs function in a way that would logically explain why she is alive or isn\u2019t dead. Ghouls can be alive by unexplained means & that\u2019s partially why they are labeled as Ghouls & the \u201cUnliving\u201d.\n\nIn summary, fiends are possessed corpses that retain their consciousness & personality, making them a unique fusion of devil and human traits. They are neither mindless zombies nor animalistic ghouls but intelligent entities capable of planning and interaction. I also believe their bodies function more or less like that of a human, which makes me believe they aren\u2019t ghouls. However, I woudlEven taking memories of the former person. More or less in Devil\u2019s like Power\u2019s case\u2026", "score": 1, "author": "Miserable-Wedding-69", "created_utc": 1753451967.0, "created_vietnam": "2025-07-25 20:59:27 +07"}

She was clearly fumbling and surprised by this whole situation. \n\nIF her last attack was an instant win move it's possible that, in this specific moment, Yoru is beyond any instant win attacks from Falling.\n\n>Durability has nothing to do with devil strength fami, falling and makina take damage from charaters that have no chance at beating them\n\nIt's not necessarily durability. Yoru could just be strong and fast enough to be able to destroy Falling's body before she can actually tear off her arm. We know she's massively faster than Falling right now, so it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility. \n\nAlso, powerscaling makes no sense in Chainsaw Man. There are almost no hard rules in the universe and Devil powers literally work off of subjective perception. Durability, speed, strength, etc... have been all over the place since the beginning.\n\nRight now Yoru is probably strong enough to shrug off Falling's attacks (which, to be fair, weren't THAT serious up until now, considering Falling wasn't feeling threatened by anyone)\n\n>Either 1 she was lying or 2 shes referring to yoru being able to injure her not being stronger than her as if she wanted to die theres no reason to fight back\n\nMaybe, but we don't know Death's plan so we don't really know what she meant. She's obviously \"special\" or important for some reason (and this reason could be something other than her ability to make weapons out of anything), otherwise she wouldn't have been in the middle of Death's scheme from the very beginning of Part 2", "score": 1, "author": "DarioFerretti", "created_utc": 1753270200.0, "created_vietnam": "2025-07-23 18:30:00 +07"}

If pochita eats the pen devil and humans learn they need a more perminant solution to pencils, they will most likely recreate pens.

The problem isn't a lack of information; the problem is the\u00a0narrative event itself. It's fundamentally broken, and no amount of retroactive exposition can fix the damage that was done to the story in this single chapter.\n\nFirst, you have the Setup: Great Tension.\u00a0The Falling Devil, a Primal Fear, had completely and utterly backed our protagonists into a corner. Yoru was on the ground, a weapon pierced clean through her skull, effectively dead or dying. The stakes were at their absolute peak. The situation felt genuinely hopeless, forcing the reader to wonder how they could\u00a0possibly\u00a0survive through wit, fighting together, or sacrifice.  \n  \nAnd then we have the most ridiculous asspull.\u00a0The solution didn't come from character, strategy, or any established ability. It came from a literal\u00a0Deus Ex Nukina (Nuke + Machina). Yoru spontaneously remembers a concept that, according to the series' most rigid and important rule, has been erased from reality. This memory, born from\u00a0nothing, instantly grants her a power-up of such magnitude that she can obliterate a Primal Devil. This is not an earned victory; it's a cheat code to bypass the point of stakes or tension.  \n  \nThis miracle didn't happen randomly. It happened at the\u00a0exact microsecond\u00a0of her defeat. The sheer, mathematical improbability of this coincidence exposes it for what it is: blatant authorial intervention. It's the writer looking at the board, realizing his characters are cornered, and flipping the entire table over instead of finding a clever move. The story didn't resolve itself; the author forced it to.\n\nNo explanation next week can rewind the clock and change this sequence. It can't un-break the tension. It can't make this unearned victory feel deserved. All it can do is staple a flimsy excuse onto a foundational crack in the narrative. Worse, it permanently lowers the stakes for the entire series. Why should we ever fear for Yoru again? If she's in a tough spot, can she just have another convenient flashback to the \"Holocaust Devil\" or the \"WWII Devil\" and get another instant win? Pochita's ultimate power has been severely cheapened, and the rules of the universe have been proven to be breakable whenever the plot demands it.
